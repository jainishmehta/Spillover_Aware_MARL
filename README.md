# MADDPG Implementation for PettingZoo MPE

A modern PyTorch implementation of Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) for PettingZoo's Multi-Agent Particle Environments, with comprehensive evaluation capabilities.

## Acknowledgments

This implementation was inspired by [legalaspro/maddpg-zoo-torch](https://github.com/legalaspro/maddpg-zoo-torch/tree/0c9e37a95727b1d52aff762cbcac4625da3dcd03). Their clean, modular code structure and modern approach to MARL implementation served as the foundation for this project.
